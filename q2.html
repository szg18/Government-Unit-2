		<p>New Jersey v. T.L.O.</p>
		<span>A decision addressing the constitutionality of a search of a public high school
		student for contraband after she was caught smoking. A subsequent search of her purse
		revealed drug paraphernalia, marijuana, and documentation of drug sales. She was charged
		as a juvenile for the drugs and paraphernalia found in the search. She fought the search,
		claiming it violated her Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches. The U.S.
		Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, held that the search by the Piscataway Township Schools
		was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</span>
